# ChopsticksGame
I would like some help and tips with;
  Networking
  Making it into a .exe
  Publishing to Steam
I'm trying to make a python-based online room-based chopsticks game, and don't really know how one would go about this
If it would be easier in java, I could also do that, maybe combine them, but outside python, I don't really know what I am doing.
Help wanted
